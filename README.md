# Split Screen Parallax Effect

This is a simple example of a split screen parallax effect, intended to be viewable on non-mobile devices. (The effect does work on smaller screen sizes, but is intended to primarily be viewed in landscape mode, not portrait) 

The aim of the project is to create a useful example of a continuously scrolling effect that doesn't impact the user experience by giving the feeling of completely pausing their scroll. The project uses HTML5 and CSS3 to achieve this.

# What I learned

- CSS3 nth child
- CSS3 `position: sticky` to remain at top
