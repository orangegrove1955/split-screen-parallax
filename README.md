# Split Screen Parallax Effect

This is a simple example of a split screen parallax effect, viewable on non-mobile devices. The aim of the project is to create a useful example of a continuously scrolling effect that doesn't impact the user experience by giving the feeling of completely pausing their scroll. The project uses plain ES6 Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3 to achieve this.
